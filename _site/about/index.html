            <h3>Investment Philosophy</h3>
            The fund seeks to outperform its benchmark, the Russell 3000 Index, primarily through stock selection alpha. This will be achieved by investing in equity securities trading meaningfully below their intrinsic value. SVF will analyze potential investments through a fundamental valuation process including a discounted cash flow analysis, comparables analysis, and HOLT valuation analysis. 
            <br><br>
            SVF aims to buy and hold these investments until they reach their intrinsic value, regardless of the time horizon. The fund’s agnostic approach to holding periods will help minimize portfolio turnover and reduce portfolio expenses. The fund will be constructed with a bottom-up basis strategy consisting of approximately 15 equity investments across various sectors, market caps, and styles with the U.S. market in order to minimize idiosyncratic risk.

            <h3>Educational Philosophy</h3>
            SVF was introduced to Northeastern University as a mechanism of extracurricular and hands on education. The fund's most important goals include to promote greater knowledge about financial markets and to provide the opportunity for NU students to be able to participate in a professional and dynamic environment. 

            We strongly believe in fostering a learning environment by providing students, regardless of their major, with application and lively discussion . In a continually globalized and competitive financial industry, we think that every student should always be looking for opportunities of active engagement in order to be more successful in the future. SVF will always work with the foremost goal of improving the education attained by NU students.
