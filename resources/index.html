<div class = "row" id = "body">
    <div class="col-md-6">
    Every analyst gets uninhibited access to a Dropbox account with years of market research, custom spreadsheets, and hard-to-come-by investment articles and literature.
    <hr>
    Analysts also enjoy the opportunity to become involved in the community and receive mentorship from talented students and advisors. The club participates in the Internal Business Case Competition, NUCAIS, and the Economics Society Symposium, among other events.

    Senior analysts enjoy access to Credit Suisse's Holt Web Application. The senior members use the application for valuation purposes and control the other analysts' valuations.
    <hr>
    Finally, the Fund provides members with an opportunity for networking. Part of our mission is to build strong relationships within the club. Because members of the club are very driven and successful (just look to our alumni list), these connections are extremely valuable.
